# Pokemon App

This project fetches data from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and reduces each Pokemonâ€™s data structure for easier handling. It displays the following information for each Pokemon:
- Name
- ID
- Base experience
- Height
- Weight
- Types (e.g., grass, poison, water)
- Five moves with their names, accuracy, and power values
- An image of the Pokemon (front image URL)

The reduced data is saved as a JSON file, and there is a route to display this data in a visually pleasing UI.
